# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Task 1

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is part of my **internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd.**, focusing on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python. The objective is to analyze a given dataset, clean the data, visualize key trends, and extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing values.
- Conduct **statistical analysis** on key attributes.
- Create **visualizations** to identify patterns and trends.
- Detect **outliers** and understand data distributions.
- Provide **business insights** based on the findings.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- **GitHub** (for version control)

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **sales transactions**, including:
- Sales values
- Time-based sales trends
- Transaction details

---

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights

### 📈 Sales Distribution (Histogram)
- **Description:** The histogram represents the distribution of sales values, showing how frequently different sales amounts occur.
- **Insights:**
  - The **distribution is right-skewed**, indicating that most sales happen at lower values (0-200).
  - **Higher sales values occur less frequently.**
  - A **density curve** suggests a peak at lower sales, with a gradual decline.

### 📉 Outlier Detection (Boxplot)
- **Description:** The boxplot highlights extreme sales values that may be considered outliers.
- **Insights:**
  - Some transactions have **significantly higher sales amounts**, requiring further analysis to determine their impact.

### 📊 Trend Analysis (Time Series)
- **Description:** Sales patterns were analyzed over time.
- **Insights:**
  - The data shows **fluctuations in sales**, suggesting **seasonal trends** or the influence of promotions.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The analysis revealed that:
- Most sales transactions are **small in value**, with a few **high-value transactions**.
- The presence of **outliers** may indicate exceptional cases (e.g., bulk purchases or errors).
- **Time-based trends** hint at **seasonal demand variations**.

These insights can help in:
✅ Optimizing **pricing & discount strategies**  
✅ Identifying **high-performing products**  
✅ Planning **future sales campaigns**
